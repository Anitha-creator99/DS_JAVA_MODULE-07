# Ex9 Finding the Longest Length of Nested Set in a Permutation Array
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program that finds the length of the longest set s[k] defined as s[k] = { nums[k], nums[nums[k]], nums[nums[nums[k]]], â€¦ },where the iteration stops before a duplicate element occurs.

The task is to return the maximum size among all such sets.
